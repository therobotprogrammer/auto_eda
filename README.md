Machine Learning Tool


Data cleaning, Pipeline management & Visualization Tool for Machine Learning	  

•	Implemented a custom grammar to run entire ML experiment (including data cleaning, EDA & tuning) using a single config

•	Generates reports for data analysis, e.g., data distributions, missing & unique data, correlated features, PCA, TSNE plots etc

•	Adds functionality to SKlearn’s pipeline to allow multiple algorithms at every step in the pipeline. 

•	Generates a report with interactive plots comparing hyperparameters & performance of multiple algorithms in the pipeline

•	Accelerates pipelines by reusing results and supports parallel execution using DASK for distributed computing on a cluster
